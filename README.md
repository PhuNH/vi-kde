# vi-kde
KDE Vietnamese translation

This repo is a clone of a part of the KDE SVN repo which can be explored at websvn.kde.org.
- Updates from the SVN repo is pushed into this repo everyday at 7:00 GMT;
- When there is a new update in the master branch, it will be committed to the SVN repo;
- Before a PR can be merged, I need to manually update the master branch with contents from the SVN repo.

## For translation work
- Fork this repo and clone the fork to your machine;
- 'Open project...' in Lokalize, select 'trunk/l10n-support/vi/index.lokalize';
- Use the Glossary in Lokalize while translating (the file is at 'trunk/l10n-support/vi/glossary.tbx');
- When you finish, give me a PR.

## Anything else
Just ask.
