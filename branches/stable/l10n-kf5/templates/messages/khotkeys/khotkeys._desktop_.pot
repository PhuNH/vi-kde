"Read the comment on the \"Type 'Hello'\" action first.\\n\\nQt Designer uses "
"Ctrl+F4 for closing windows.  In KDE, however, Ctrl+F4 is the shortcut for "
"going to virtual desktop 4, so this shortcut does not work in Qt Designer.  "
"Further, Qt Designer does not use KDE's standard Ctrl+W for closing the "
"window.\\n\\nThis problem can be solved by remapping Ctrl+W to Ctrl+F4 when "
"the active window is Qt Designer. When Qt Designer is active, every time Ctrl"
"+W is pressed, Ctrl+F4 will be sent to Qt Designer instead. In other "
"applications, the effect of Ctrl+W is unchanged.\\n\\nWe now need to specify "
"three things: A new shortcut trigger on 'Ctrl+W', a new keyboard input "
"action sending Ctrl+F4, and a new condition that the active window is Qt "
"Designer.\\nQt Designer seems to always have title 'Qt Designer by "
"Trolltech', so the condition will check for the active window having that "
"title."

"Konqueror in KDE3.1 has tabs, and now you can also have gestures.\\n\\nJust "
"press the middle mouse button and start drawing one of the gestures, and "
"after you are finished, release the mouse button. If you only need to paste "
"the selection, it still works, just click the middle mouse button. (You can "
"change the mouse button to use in the global settings).\\n\\nRight now, "
"there are the following gestures available:\\nmove right and back left - "
"Forward (Alt+Right)\\nmove left and back right - Back (Alt+Left)\\nmove up "
"and back down  - Up (Alt+Up)\\ncircle counterclockwise - Reload (F5)\\n"
"\\nThe gesture shapes can be entered by performing them in the configuration "
"dialog. You can also look at your numeric pad to help you: gestures are "
"recognized like a 3x3 grid of fields, numbered 1 to 9.\\n\\nNote that you "
"must perform exactly the gesture to trigger the action. Because of this, it "
"is possible to enter more gestures for the action. You should try to avoid "
"complicated gestures where you change the direction of mouse movement more "
"than once.  For instance, 45654 or 74123 are simple to perform, but 1236987 "
"may be already quite difficult.\\n\\nThe conditions for all gestures are "
"defined in this group. All these gestures are active only if the active "
"window is Konqueror (class contains 'konqueror')."
