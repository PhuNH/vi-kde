"Checkers is played by two opponents, on opposite sides of the gameboard. One "
"player has the dark pieces; the other has the light pieces. Players "
"alternate turns. A player may not move an opponent's piece. A move consists "
"of moving a piece diagonally to an adjacent unoccupied square. If the "
"adjacent square contains an opponent's piece, and the square immediately "
"beyond it is vacant, the piece may be captured (and removed from the game) "
"by jumping over it.\n"
"Only the dark squares of the checkered board are used. A piece may move only "
"diagonally into an unoccupied square. Capturing is mandatory. The player "
"without pieces remaining, or who cannot move due to being blocked, loses the "
"game.\n"
"When a man reaches the crownhead or kings row (the farthest row forward), it "
"becomes a king, and is marked by placing an additional piece on top of the "
"first man, and acquires additional powers including the ability to move "
"backwards. If there is a piece in a diagonal that a king can capture, he can "
"move any distance along the diagonal, and may capture an opposing man any "
