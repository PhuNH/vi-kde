"When reviewing the SUS action logs for Okular for the Blauer Engel "

"Several other issues were brought to the virtual table. Nicolas Fella, a "
"software engineer at KDAB Berlin, expressed interest in comparing two chat "
"clients, which shifted the conversation to defining single scenarios when "
"comparing two applications with similar usage. A single SUS will limit which"
" software functions can be tested, but it will make results from the "
"measurements directly comparable. Moreover, for client-server software such "
"as a chat or email clients, there is the issue of the network component, "
"which for controlled testing would require setting up and measuring the "
"energy consumption of a server. Former KDE e.V. president and long-time KDE "
"contributor [Cornelius "
"Schumacher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornelius_Schumacher) pointed out "
"that for the [KMail measurements](https://invent.kde.org/teams/eco/blue-"

"Another topic discussed was defining SUS actions abstractly in order to "
"automate the implementation of usage scenarios with different tools "

"The online Sprint was a wonderful opportunity to bring the community "
"together and move the KDE Eco project forward, especially as we prepare for "
"the community measurement lab that will be held at KDAB Berlin and the first"
" of many measure-athons (planned for early 2022)! The success of such events"
" depends first and foremost on the community, so allow us to send a "
"heartfelt thank you to everyone who joined the conversation. We look forward"
" to making the community grow in 2022! Moreover, we could not do what we do "
"without the support of KDE e.V. as well as "
"[BMU](www.bmu.de)/[UBA](https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en), who financially "
"support the BE4FOSS project (although only the publisher is responsible for "

"So when thinking about what to do while the climate crisis continues, where "
