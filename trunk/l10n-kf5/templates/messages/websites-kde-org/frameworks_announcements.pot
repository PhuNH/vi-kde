"July 7th, 2014. The KDE Community is proud to announce KDE Frameworks 5.0. "
"Frameworks 5 is the next generation of KDE libraries, modularized and "
"optimized for easy integration in Qt applications. The Frameworks offer a "
"wide variety of commonly needed functionality in mature, peer reviewed and "
"well tested libraries with friendly licensing terms. There are over 50 "
"different Frameworks as part of this release providing solutions including "
"hardware integration, file format support, additional widgets, plotting "
"functions, spell checking and more. Many of the Frameworks are cross "
"platform and have minimal or no extra dependencies making them easy to build"
" and add to any Qt application."

" well documented and tested and their usage will be familiar to Qt "
"developers, following the style and standards set by the Qt Project. "
"Frameworks are developed under the proven KDE governance model with a "

"New module. The Quick Charts module provides a set of charts that can be "
"used from QtQuick applications. They are intended to be used for both simple"
" display of data as well as continuous display of high-volume data (often "
"referred to as plotters). The charts use a system called distance fields for"
" their accelerated rendering, which provides ways of using the GPU for "
"rendering 2D shapes without loss of quality."
