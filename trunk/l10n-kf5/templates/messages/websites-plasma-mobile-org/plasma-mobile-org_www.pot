"Plasma Mobile is a software platform for mobile devices. It is not an "
"operating system in itself, it consists of Qt5, the KDE Frameworks, Plasma "
"and various software that's part of the application set. Plasma Mobile can "
"work on top of the Mer distribution, but due to a lack of time and "
"resources, we're currently focusing on KDE Neon on PinePhone as a base for "
"testing and development."

"There are projects like [Anbox](https://anbox.io/) which is Android running "

"Mobile platform, but it's a complicated task, and as of *today*(September "
