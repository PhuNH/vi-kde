"This theme uses JavaScript heavily to provide smooth photo gallery. "
"Naturally images can be navigated without JavaScript support similarly as "

"image (by default) on right. The largest generated images can be viewed "
"either with manual navigation or slide show. This theme works best with "
"rather small images that can fully fit to the screen."
